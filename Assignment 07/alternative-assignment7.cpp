/*
Tour operator organizes guided bus trips across the Maharashtra.
Tourists may have different preferences. Tour operator offers a choice
from many different routes. Every day the bus moves from starting city
S to another city F as chosen by client. On this way, the tourists can see
the sights alongside the route travelled from S to F. Client may have
preference to choose route. There is a restriction on the routes that the
tourists may choose from, the bus has to take a short route from S to F
or a route having one distance unit longer than the minimal distance.
Two routes from S to F are considered different if there is at least one
road from a city A to a city B which is part of one route, but not of the
other route
