## <span id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</span> - Binary Tree  

### Problem Statement
  
```
Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform
following operations on it-
1 Perform in order / pre order and post order traversal
2 Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are
swapped at every node
3 Find the height of tree
4 Copy this tree to another [operator=]
5 Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes.
6 Erase all nodes in a binary tree.
(implement both recursive and non-recursive methods)
```

## <span id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</span> - Binary Search Tree

### Problem Statement
```
Beginning with an empty binary search tree. Construct the binary
search tree by inserting the values in given order. After constructing
binary search tree perform following operations 1) Insert a new node 2)
Find numbers of node in longest path 3) Minimum and maximum data
value found in tree 4) Change a tree so that the roles of the left and
right pointers are swapped at every node 5)Search an element
```

## <span id="assignment-3">Assignment 3</span> - Threaded Binary Search Tree

### Problem Statement
```
Create an inordered threaded binary search tree. Perform inorder,
preorder traversals without recursion and deletion of a node. Analyze
time and space complexity of the algorithm.
```

## <span id="assignment-4">Assignment 4</span> - Hash Table Implementation

### Problem Statement
```
Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash
table implementation to quickly look up clientâ€™s telephone number.
Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using
number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers
(Note: Use linear probing with replacement and without replacement)
```

## <span id="assignment-5">Assignment 5</span> - Dictionary ADT Implementation using Open Hashing

### Problem Statement
  
```
Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open
hashing technique: separate chaining using linked list Data: Set of
(key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be
comparable, and Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert
(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)
```

## <span id="assignment-6"></span>Assignment 6 - Graph using Adjacency List  

### Problem Statement
```
Represent a given graph using adjacency list to perform DFS and BFS.
Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the
prominent landmarks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.
```
